### July 31, 2025 - Day 1

Today, I learned how to create my first functional PCB, and it was eye opening for me. I started by opening https://hackpad.hackclub.com/ and downloading all the requisite files that the tutorial requested. From there, I was able to create my schematic, and everything was
smooth sailing.. until I proceeded to struggle with uploading my footprints for 2 hours straight. But once I was able to properly obtain the footprint and add it to my design, KiCAD decided to crash on me, so that was also fun. But once I finally got my PCB formatted with 
the correct footprints, I was able to get to work and finally wire up my PCB. This was when I also learned that as long as you have the right components AND you're able to wire things correctly in your schematic, it's simple from there because KiCad will have a lot of 
guidelines and you can connect all of the wires without any problems. One thing that I was able to grasp surprisingly quickly was how I was able to learn how to use front and back side wires. Once I was finished, I added some text and added it to the side of my PCB.  
Finally, I was able to take a screenshot and extract a Gerber file, and now my PCB is shipment-ready!

After struggling for nearly a month, I realized that all I needed was a simple tutorial to start making my PCB. After I created this hackpad, I realized that creating PCBs is simple; you just need the right tutorial. I'd highly recommend making a hackpad to anyone out there
who wants to make their PCB because I was able to learn so much, from uploading the footprint and symbols, to making the schematic, and learning to wire your PCB. It may have been a simple project, but just by sitting down and learning to create this simple PCB, you're able
to learn so much.

Now, does that mean just because I did this tutorial, I'm suddenly a master at making PCBs? No, not at all. I still have much to learn about the world of PCBs. But just from this one PCB, it's sparked my determination to finally create the PCB that I dreamed of from the 
start.
